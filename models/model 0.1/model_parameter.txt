input neuron dynamics:

excitatory neuron dynamics:
    potential:  # differential equation for potential evolution due to leakage
        v(0) = 0
        dv/dt = -v/50*ms
    threshold:  # differential equation for threshold evolution due to homeostasis

        vt_exc_rest = 0.2
        dvt_exc/dt = (vt_exc_rest - vt_exc)/2000*ms
    on_spike:   # change to potential and threshold on spike event
        v = 0
        vt_exc = 1.25 * vt_exc
        # on spike, synapse weight appllies to post neurons (inhib) 

inhibitory neuron dynamics:
    potential:
        v(0) = 0
        dv/dt = -v/100*ms
    threshold:
        vt_inh = 0.2
    on_spike:
        v = 0
        v_pre = 0.5 * v_pre # pre neuron potential is halved on inhib spike
